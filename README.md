# THREE_TransformController_UI_UX

## Link to the Application
- https://bit.ly/TransformControls

## Section 1 - Overview 
- This application primary focuses on the different properties on a mesh and how to edit them accordingly. 


## Section 2 - Purpose 
- The purpose of this application gives the user the ability to transform, translate, rotate, or scale any mesh. 


## Section 3 - Directions
1. When the user is in the dimensional space, the user can orbit the object in the middle of the dimensional space using the left click. Additionally they can pan or translate the camera sideways with the right click. 
2. The user, by pressing the 'W' key, can change the location of any object. 
3. The user, by pressing the 'E' key, can rotate the object in any three dimensional rotation. 
4. The user, by pressing the 'R' key, can scale the object to any three dimensional scale. 
5. The user, by pressing the 'Q' key, can reset the position of the editor to the mesh.
6. The user, by pressing the 'Shift' key, can snap the object to the grid shown.
7. The user, by pressing the 'X' key, can toggle the x editor on the mesh.
8. The user, by pressing the 'Y' key, can toggle the y editor on the mesh.
9. The user, by pressing the 'Z' key, can toggle the z editor on the mesh.
10. The user, by pressing the 'Spacebar', can leave the mesh toggle and freely work from the mesh.
11. The user, by pressing the 'Esc' key, can cancel the current edit on the mesh.
12. The user, by pressing the 'C' key, can toggle the view of the camera's Perspective camera to an Orthographic camera.
13. The user, by pressing the 'V' key, can randomly zoom in with the camera with changes of persective occuring. 


## Section 4 - Notes 
- No current notes. 


## Section 5 - Summary 
- This project is a smaller application I would like to build into a much larger application one day. I enjoyed building it and learning about the different types of 3D transformations in the perspective of coding.
